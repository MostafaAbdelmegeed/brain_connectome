### Brain Network - Curvature Calculation Code ###
Below is an overview of each Python file included in the folder:

1. lower_brain.py: This script calculates the lower-Ricci curvature for brain networks.
2. new_brain.py: This script is used to calculate the new curvature.
3. job_AD_50.py: This script handles job submissions for calculating both the lower-Ricci and new curvature. Update the directory paths for the graph matrices and the output curvature matrices to enable automatic execution.
